## Adolfo's wedding game


This game is all about creating challenges that will be displayed in Yu Gi Oh! like cards, since Adolfo likes so much Yu Gi Oh!.

The idea is to create as many fun challenges as possible, so that we can dare each other to execute them the night we go out.

###### Challenges cannot contain anything illegal or that would hurt others physically, morally or sentimentally.
